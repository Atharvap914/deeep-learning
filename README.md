## üìö What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning inspired by the human brain. It involves training **artificial neural networks** on large datasets to recognize patterns, make predictions, and classify data. Deep learning models are especially powerful for tasks like:

- Image Classification üì∏  
- Object Detection üéØ  
- Medical Diagnosis üè•  
- Natural Language Processing üó£Ô∏è

**Key Concepts:**
- **Neural Networks**: Layers of nodes that learn from data.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Specialized for image processing.
- **Transfer Learning**: Using pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet.
- **Segmentation vs Classification**: Classifying pixels vs whole images.
